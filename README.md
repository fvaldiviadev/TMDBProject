This **android app** shows a list of popular movies from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=es). **When the scroll reaches the end of the list, automatically load the next pages**.
Furthermore, the user has the possibility to search for a movie by keyword and the **search is automatically triggered while user is typing**. The search results can be scrollable via pagination as well.

This project has been developed in **Java**, using **Android Studio** and implementing the libraries **Retrofit and Glide**. It isnÂ´t developed with any specific pattern arquitecture. In [other projects](https://github.com/fvaldiviadev/TMDBProject-MVP) of this repository, I have developed the same functions with MVP arquitecture, which has code more cleaned and improve the separation of concerns in presentation logic. 
You can use the current project for look the differences.
